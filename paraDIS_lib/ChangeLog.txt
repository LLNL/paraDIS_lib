       Fixed a bug involving the decomposition of arms and tracing of wrapped segments that caused early termination on some data sets.  

2014-06-02: version 2.3.6
       Fixed bugs relating to very rare cases of looped arms which have wrapped segments, or decomposed arms which cross over themselves when decomposed.  
       Add --summary flag to allow all summaries to be printed in a single file.
       Improved documentation in summary files to clarify segments, arms and metaarms.  
       
2014-01-31: version 2.3.5
       Added "ScrewType" to segments for Jaime Marian; shows in VTK files but not yet VisIt plugin. 
       
2013-07-17: version 2.3.4
       Change definition of tags, only marking loop nodes with 8192 now. 
       add burgers vector to metaarm file      
       Added node tracing in addition to arm tracing.
       Fix bug where loading a second timestep in VisIt caused crashes. The notorious "second time around" bug. 

2013-05-30: version 2.3.3
       Enable the creation of "trace files" which allow user to track what happens to particular arms visually and in text

2013-05-29: version 2.3.2
       Detach any "pass-through" arms from terminal nodes before decomposing any arm.  

2013-05-24: version 2.3.1
       Various bugfixes to make the code actually produce results that are consistent with previous results. 
       Added tools to track history of arms after decomposition of higher energy arms into lower energy arms. 
       Simplified the arguments to analyzeParaDIS to make visualization easier. 
2013-04-25: version 2.3
        Implemented MetaArm visualization, including subsetting by some new variables in the meshes.  Using enumerated scalars now for better subset operations.  
        We now have metaarm visualization.  
        Added several new variables, some having to do with meta-arms, cleaned up variable naming convention, and converted some into enumerated scalars to allow subset operations to work. 
        Added the ability to write out so-called tagfiles, which are simply a copy of the original data with certain values replaced by "8" when a node is in a LOOP metaarm.
