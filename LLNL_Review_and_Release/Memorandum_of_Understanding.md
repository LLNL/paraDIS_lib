## ParaDIS_lib Review and Release :: Memorandum of Understanding

**04-28-2016**

**TO**:  Information Management (IM), L-662

**FROM**:  Richard Cook, author and developer

**SUBJECT**:  Memorandum of Understanding

The ParaDIS_lib software is a project that is funded by the DOE ASC Program. Its purpose is to provide visualization and analysis capabilities for the existing ParaDIS parallel dislocation dynamics simulation code.  I the author wish to release it as open source, to facilitate easy and wide adoption of the software in the existing community and to allow in particular myself to continue to enhance it after I leave LLNL. Version 2.6.4a is currently deployed on the Livermore Computing OCF CZ and RZ machines in /usr/local/tools/paradis-lib-2.6.4a and is used regularly by the paraDIS team at LLNL for visualization and analysis of their data. We would like release and distribution of the software by 06-01-2016 if possible.

The information that we are distributing is composed entirely of the source code for paraDIS lib, which compiles on Linux machines such as those used in LLNL LC clusters.
