# Releasing ParaDIS to open source

* Mary Holden-Sanchez is the go-to lady for this process.  She is responsive and knowledgable.
* The checklist is at  <https://im-int.llnl.gov/rr-software.html>
* The form from step 1 is a bit out of order.  Follow  https://im-int.llnl.gov/rr-software.html in order.
* When doing Memorandum of Understanding per item 5, put that it was funded by ASC in there, that will help.
* Here are the highlights:   Be sure to get it right.

 * Get the software on CD
 *  Fill out the memorandum of understanding -- NEED CITATIONS
 *  Get R&R via the DC Tom Arsenlis -- IN PROGRESS
 *  Use LL6566 from paradis directory.  Get LL6566 signed by Trish D (Damkroger I think) on line 3c
 *   After that, then bring it to Mary Holdens in 1677, room 1020 behind a door.  Close to west gate
 *   After she signs, then take to OCEC
 *   Then finally take to IM for final release, including the 2 identical disks with source code, format is irrelevant to that medium.

* Should be quick if all ducks are in a row.

* Is there any third party code included?  This is what hangs things up if they exist and you're doing BSD.  Be sure to list completely.
