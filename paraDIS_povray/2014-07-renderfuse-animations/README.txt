The purpose of this directory is to create an animation of the camera following an arm for a single timestep. 

Each animation will be stored in a separate git branch.  The README.branch will hopefully be modified for each animation.  

As of the end of this phase of the project, the process was to run analyzeParaDIS on a dumpfile, creating the "decl" and "obj" files.  

analyzeParaDIS(rs0240.data) -> rs0240.{decl,pov}
