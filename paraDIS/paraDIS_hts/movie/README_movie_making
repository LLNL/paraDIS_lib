It all starts with jobscript.sh.  If you look at pscript.psub, which is the actual script I used to make a movie, you can see that it simply submits a job that runs jobscript.sh with no arguments. 
jobscript.sh looks to see what machine you are on and fires off makewormmovie.sh with various flags to tell it what is going on.  -p means "parallel."  jobscript.sh was really invented to overcome a deficiency that used to exist with pscript.sh and I'm not sure it's needed any longer. 
makewormmovie.sh is the heart of the story.  makewormmovie.sh assumes you are making a movie with a prolog, an animation, and an epilog.  The prolog and epilog consist of the first frame, but advancing the clock.  The animation runs through the frames and advances the clock regularly.  The epilog advances the clock over the last frame.  Typically a logfile is generated per parallel process and is stored with the output images.  An example of one of these logs is at ./example-makewormmovie.sh.log.  
Each frame is defined by a povray file which describes the scene to render.  Each povray file typically includes a header file which describes how to move the camera and possibly other attributes with respect to the clock values, and also defines certain items which are constant or required defines.  It implements some snazzy graphics doodads as well. Read it and laugh.   It's ugly, messy and probably even wrong in some way.  
See the quicklook.sh script in ScienceCover for a way to speed up rendering to take quick looks at the data with various angles and settings, using multires, etc. 
The povray files were generated by applying restartConvert to various paraDIS output files, with some magic incantations.  That's another story entirely, but worth noting.  

examples: 
for the 2005-11 movie, from the example log: 
/g/g0/rcook/current_projects/paraDIS_hts/movie/makewormmovie.sh run with args -datadir /nfs/tmp0/rcook/paradis/2005-11/movie/pov -moviedir /nfs/tmp0/rcook/paradis/2005-11/movie/480-360 -v 5 -padlength 4 -povname converted_restart -prologframes 0 -epilogframes 0 -width 480 -height 360 -backdrop -povstep 4 -povfirst 75 -povlast 5487 -animstart 0.0 -animend 1.0 -parallel -firstframe 569

The init file for frame 760 is at example-worms_0760.ini
