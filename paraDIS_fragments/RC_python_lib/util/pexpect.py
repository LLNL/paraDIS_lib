"""
Pexpect is a Python module for spawning child applications;
controlling them; and responding to expected patterns in their output.
Pexpect can be used for automating interactive applications such as
ssh, ftp, passwd, telnet, etc. It can be used to a automate setup scripts
for duplicating software package installations on different servers.
It can be used for automated software testing. Pexpect is in the spirit of
Don Libes' Expect, but Pexpect is pure Python. Other Expect-like
modules for Python require TCL and Expect or require C extensions to
be compiled. Pexpect does not use C, Expect, or TCL extensions. It
should work on any platform that supports the standard Python pty
module. The Pexpect interface focuses on ease of use so that simple
tasks are easy.

Pexpect is Open Source, Free, and all Good that stuff.

        This allows you to write code like this:
                index = p.expect (['good', 'bad', pexpect.EOF])
                if index == 0:
                    do_something()
                elif index == 1:
                    do_something_else()
                elif index == 2:
                    do_some_other_thing()
        instead of code like this:
                try:
                    index = p.expect (['good', 'bad'])
                    if index == 0:
                        do_something()
                    elif index == 1:

                except EOF:
                    do_some_other_thing()
        These two forms are equivalent. It all depends on what you want.
        You can also just expect the EOF if you are waiting for all output
        of a child to finish. For example:
                p = pexpect.spawn('/bin/ls')
                p.expect (pexpect.EOF)
                print p.before

### Weird bug. If you read too fast after doing a sendline()

# the child did not echo the data. This is particularly a problem if
# you send a password.

# if the lookahead failed then Pexpect would "push-back" the data
# that was read. The idea was to allow read() to read blocks of data.
# What I do now is just read one character at a time and then try a
# match. This is not as efficient, but it works well enough for the
# output of most applications and it makes program logic much simpler.
