# paraDIS_lib

paraDIS_lib is a library that provides the ability to create useful visualizations and detailed analysis of dumpfiles created from a ParaDIS simulation code. 

Despite its name, paraDIS_lib does not produce a C library.  Instead, compiling it creates an executable, analyzeParaDIS, which can be used to analyze a ParaDIS dumpfile.  

See <http://paradis.stanford.edu> for more information about ParaDIS.  The image displayed on the ParaDIS website was created with the analyzeParaDIS tool, which is part of paraDIS_lib.

## Compiling
