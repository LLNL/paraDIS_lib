I'd like to encode the burgers vector in such a way that
1)  it's not wasteful of space
2)  it's not hard to compute
3)  it works with the paradis reader (can be converted to integer easily)
4)  I don't need to keep creating tables of #defines and strings to name things

Currently I do #1-#3 by storing as an integer.  I should keep doing this, but find a way to automatically convert between the integers, the names, and the original burgers values. 
Let's just go with enumerated lists.  

We need GetBurgersType() to return an integer to make most of the code work. 

What do we do in the code with the output of GetBurgersType()  
     1.  We check to see if they are in the range 10-13 (type 111).  
     2.  We compare them to each other for equality.
     3.  We use them in VisIt
